      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;post-picture&#34;&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://www.burakaltundal.com/images/gokce-erbil-passenger.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gökçe Erbil&#34; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gökçe Erbil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear passenger*,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you vanished behind the doors of the airport, all doors turned into walls. A second ago I could do everything, now everything I do, I say hit a wall and fall. A hugproof, kissproof, soundproof wall between us. How much pain is too much pain, I wonder. And how to describe too much pain? For many years I asked myself what is a language? Many think that it helps to understand each other. Very sceptical about that. Maybe it works for communication but understanding? While we discuss I barely understand some of the things you really care. If it’s been only talking I wouldn’t be able to understand you at all, even though we share the same mother tongue. I understand more from your eyes, hands. Communication vs understanding, talking vs telling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
